# Fabric

This is React application. At the '/' route, there will be input field and user need to write url. For example, "/fabric/22". 
At the route "/fabric/:id", this is responsive layout which is built in bootstrap.
The Design Inspiration section is just the random pic with dummy text because
I couldn't find the api end point to fetch that design data.
For the custom theme, I just override the parimary value of bootstrap because I am not sure what theme should I changed.
This shows that I am able to change the or customize the theme of bootstrap.
